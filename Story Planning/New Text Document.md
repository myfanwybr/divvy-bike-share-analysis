#Data Visualization Planning a Data Story

I use the following template to document my lan for a well-organized data analysis project.

Situation: Uncontroversial situation stakeholders believe to be true

Complication: Complication to that situation which creates tension

(Implied Question): Question created in the audienceâ€™s mind by the Situation + Complication combination, usually implied

Key Questions: Questions that you will explore through your analysis

Data: Metric, Key Performance Indicator (KPI), or measure that you will collect and analyze

Source: Place where each piece of data can be found typically stated as some database, survey, or report that houses the data 

Key these required elements directly into the space allowed on the next slide.
